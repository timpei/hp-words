        "Chapter 1", 
        "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be in\u00advolved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense.", 
        "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al\u00adthough he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy any\u00adwhere.", 
        "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.", 
        "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen\u00ading all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.", 
        "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.", 
        "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive.", 
        "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar \u2014 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Durs\u00adley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \u2014 no,  at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps  signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.", 
        "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis\u00adpering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt \u2014 these people were obviously collecting for some\u00adthing \u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.", 
        "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.  didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped over\u00adhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important tele\u00adphone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.", 
        "He\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.", 
        "\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201c\u2014 yes, their son, Harry \u2014\u201d", 
        "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.", 
        "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking \u2026 no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Pot\u00adter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew  called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in wor\u00adrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her \u2014 if  had a sister like that \u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks \u2026", 
        "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.", 
        "\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being al\u00admost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Re\u00adjoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like your\u00adself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d", 
        "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.", 
        "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination.", 
        "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.", 
        "\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.", 
        "The cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this nor\u00admal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself to\u00adgether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.", 
        "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over din\u00adner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:", 
        "\u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster al\u00adlowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d", 
        "\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early \u2014 it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d", 
        "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters \u2026", 
        "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr \u2014 Petunia, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d", 
        "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. Af\u00adter all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister.", 
        "\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d", 
        "\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls \u2026 shooting stars \u2026 and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201c?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.", 
        "\u201cWell, I just thought \u2026 maybe \u2026 it was something to do with \u2026 you know \u2026  crowd.\u201d", 
        "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", 
        "\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d", 
        "He didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front gar\u00adden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.", 
        "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did \u2026 if it got out that they were related to a pair of \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it.", 
        "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters  involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. \u2026 He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \u2014 he yawned and turned over \u2014 it couldn\u2019t affect", 
        "How very wrong he was.", 
        "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far cor\u00adner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.", 
        "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, ap\u00adpeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes nar\u00adrowed.", 
        "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore.", 
        "Albus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwel\u00adcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for some\u00adthing. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d", 
        "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again \u2014 the next lamp flickered into dark\u00adness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.", 
        "\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d", 
        "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.", 
        "\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.", 
        "\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.", 
        "\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d", 
        "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.", 
        "\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no \u2014 even the Mug\u00adgles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living-room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls \u2026 shooting stars. \u2026 Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shoot\u00ading stars down in Kent \u2014 I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d", 
        "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really  gone, Dumbledore?\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d", 
        "\u201cA ?\u201d", 
        "\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who  gone \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense \u2014 for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: \u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dum\u00adbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to no\u00adtice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI know you haven\u2019t,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You-Know- oh, all right,  was fright\u00adened of.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d", 
        "\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too \u2014 well \u2014  to use them.\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d", 
        "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the  that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disap\u00adpeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d", 
        "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.", 
        "\u201cWhat they\u2019re \u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Vol\u00addemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Pot\u00adters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are \u2014 are \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 \u201d", 
        "Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.", 
        "\u201cLily and James \u2026 I can\u2019t believe it \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to believe it \u2026 Oh, Albus \u2026\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know \u2026 I know \u2026\u201d he said heavily.", 
        "Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potters\u2019 son, Harry. But \u2014 he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke \u2014 and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore nodded glumly.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s ?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done \u2026 all the people he\u2019s killed \u2026 he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding \u2026 of all the things to stop him \u2026 but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d", 
        "\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d", 
        "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; in\u00adstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d", 
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me  you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t mean \u2014 you  mean the people who live ?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son \u2014 I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d", 
        "\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous \u2014 a legend \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future \u2014 there will be books written about Harry \u2014 every child in our world will know his name!\u201d", 
        "\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d", 
        "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes \u2014 yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak sud\u00addenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.",

        "\u201cYou think it \u2014  \u2014 to trust Hagrid with something as im\u00adportant as this?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to \u2014 what was that?\u201d", 
        "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \u2014 and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.", 
        "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so  \u2014 long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.", 
        "\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d", 
        "\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climb\u00ading carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo, sir \u2014 house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a cu\u00adriously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.", 
        "\u201cIs that where \u2014 ?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.", 
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d", 
        "\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d", 
        "\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Un\u00adderground. Well \u2014 give him here, Hagrid \u2014 we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house.", 
        "\u201cCould I \u2014 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.", 
        "\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Mug\u00adgles!\u201d", 
        "\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handker\u00adchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it \u2014 Lily an\u2019 James dead \u2014 an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.", 
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019d best get this bike away. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall \u2014 Professor Dumble\u00addore, sir.\u201d", 
        "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.", 
        "\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.", 
        "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.", 
        "\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.", 
        "A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not know\u00ading he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. \u2026 He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter \u2014 the boy who lived!\u201d"

    [
        "Chapter 2", 
        "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gar\u00addens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantel\u00adpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley Durs\u00adley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.", 
        "Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.", 
        "\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d", 
        "Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.", 
        "\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.", 
        "His aunt was back outside the door.", 
        "\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.", 
        "\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d", 
        "Harry groaned.", 
        "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.", 
        "\u201cNothing, nothing \u2026\u201d", 
        "Dudley\u2019s birthday \u2014 how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.", 
        "When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday pres\u00adents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise \u2014 unless of course it in\u00advolved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.", 
        "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held to\u00adgether with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could re\u00admember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.", 
        "\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d", 
        "\u2014 that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.", 
        "Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.", 
        "\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.", 
        "About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way \u2014 all over the place.", 
        "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \u2014 Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.", 
        "Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.", 
        "\u201cThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d", 
        "\u201cAll right, thirty-seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.", 
        "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another  presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin?  more presents. Is that all right?\u201d", 
        "Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty \u2026 thirty \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cThirty-nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.", 
        "\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d", 
        "Uncle Vernon chuckled.", 
        "\u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.", 
        "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.", 
        "\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.", 
        "Dudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.", 
        "\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.", 
        "\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d", 
        "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there \u2014 or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.", 
        "\u201cWhat about what\u2019s-her-name, your friend \u2014 Yvonne?\u201d", 
        "\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.", 
        "\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).", 
        "Aunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.", 
        "\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.", 
        "\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listen\u00ading.", 
        "\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026 and leave him in the car. \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cThat cars new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone. \u2026\u201d", 
        "Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying \u2014 it had been years since he\u2019d really cried \u2014 but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him any\u00adthing he wanted.", 
        "\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.", 
        "\u201cI \u2026 don\u2019t \u2026 want \u2026 him \u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.", 
        "Just then, the doorbell rang \u2014 \u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically \u2014 and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.", 
        "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sit\u00adting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but be\u00adfore they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy \u2014 any funny business, anything at all \u2014 and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d", 
        "I\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly \u2026\u201d", 
        "But Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.", 
        "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.", 
        "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the bar\u00adbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petu\u00adnia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he  explain how it had grown back so quickly.", 
        "Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t pun\u00adished.", 
        "On the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had re\u00adceived a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cup\u00adboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.", 
        "But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth be\u00ading with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling living room.", 
        "While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.", 
        "\u201c\u2026 roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.", 
        "\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d", 
        "Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d", 
        "Dudley and Piers sniggered.", 
        "\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d", 
        "But he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talk\u00ading about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon \u2014 they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.", 
        "It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with fam\u00adilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.", 
        "Harry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.", 
        "Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.", 
        "After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can \u2014 but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.", 
        "Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.", 
        "\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.", 
        "\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.", 
        "\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.", 
        "Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself \u2014 no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than hav\u00ading a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petu\u00adnia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.", 
        "The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.", 
        "It winked.", 
        "Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.", 
        "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:", 
        "\u201c\u201d", 
        "\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d", 
        "The snake nodded vigorously.", 
        "\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.", 
        "The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.", 
        "Boa Constrictor, Brazil.", 
        "\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d", 
        "The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see \u2014 so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d", 
        "As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T  WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d", 
        "Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.", 
        "\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened \u2014 one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.", 
        "Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.", 
        "As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come. \u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d", 
        "The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.", 
        "\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d", 
        "The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dud\u00adley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d", 
        "Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house be\u00adfore starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo \u2014 cupboard \u2014 stay \u2014 no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.", 
        "Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Durs\u00adleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.", 
        "He\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn\u00ading pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.", 
        "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.", 
        "At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and bro\u00adken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang."

        "Chapter 3", 
        "The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote con\u00adtrol airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.", 
        "Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dud\u00adley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.", 
        "This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holi\u00addays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was go\u00ading there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.", 
        "\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it \u2014 it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.", 
        "One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of choco\u00adlate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.", 
        "That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good train\u00ading for later life.", 
        "As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Ver\u00adnon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.", 
        "* * *", 
        "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.", 
        "\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.", 
        "Harry looked in the bowl again.", 
        "\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d", 
        "Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High \u2014 like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.", 
        "Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.", 
        "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.", 
        "\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his pa\u00adper.", 
        "\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d",

        "\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d", 
        "Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown enve\u00adlope that looked like a bill, and \u2014", 
        "Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a gi\u00adant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives \u2014 he didn\u2019t be\u00adlong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:",

        "The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.", 
        "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a pur\u00adple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter", 
        "\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.", 
        "Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.", 
        "Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.", 
        "\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk \u2026\u201d",

        "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was writ\u00adten on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.", 
        "\u201cThat\u2019s !\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.", 
        "\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.", 
        "\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.", 
        "Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.", 
        "\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness \u2014 Vernon!\u201d", 
        "They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ig\u00adnored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.", 
        "\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.", 
        "\u201c want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s \u201d",

        "\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.", 
        "\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address \u2014 how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d", 
        "\u201cWatching \u2014 spying \u2014 might be following us,\u201d muttered Un\u00adcle Vernon wildly.",

        "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cup\u00adboard.", 
        "\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Ver\u00adnon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d",

        "\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.", 
        "\u201cEr \u2014 yes, Harry \u2014 about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking \u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it \u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bed\u00adroom.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff up\u00adstairs, now.\u201d", 
        "The Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first-ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.", 
        "From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t  him in there \u2026 I  that room \u2026 make him get out. \u2026\u201d", 
        "Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cup\u00adboard with that letter than up here without it.", 
        "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tor\u00adtoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.", 
        "When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Small\u00adest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive \u2014\u2019 \u201d", 
        "With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wres\u00adtle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.", 
        "\u201cGo to your cupboard \u2014 I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley \u2014 go \u2014 just go.\u201d", 
        "Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.", 
        "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.", 
        "He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door \u2014", 
        "\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d", 
        "Harry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat \u2014 something !", 
        "Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been try\u00ading to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters ad\u00addressed in green ink.", 
        "\u201cI want \u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.", 
        "Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.", 
        "\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t  them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d",

        "\u201cOh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.", 
        "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.", 
        "Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.", 
        "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden in\u00adside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.",

        "\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d", 
        "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.", 
        "\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d", 
        "He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.", 
        "They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.",

        "Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. \u2026",

Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.", 
        "\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.",

If it  Mon\u00adday \u2014 and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television \u2014 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never ex\u00adactly fun \u2014 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.", 
        "Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carry\u00ading a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.", 
        "\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d", 
        "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.", 
        "\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clap\u00adping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d", 
        "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d", 
        "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slip\u00adping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.", 
        "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.", 
        "Uncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.", 
        "\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheer\u00adfully.", 
        "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.", 
        "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.", 
        "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near mid\u00adnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, won\u00addering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.", 
        "Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.", 
        "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?", 
        "One minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds \u2026 twenty \u2026 ten \u2026 nine \u2014 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \u2014 three \u2026 two \u2026 one \u2026",

        "\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you \u2014 I\u2019m armed!\u201d",

        "SMASH!", 
        "The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.", 
        "A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was al\u00admost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.", 
        "The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm out\u00adside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.", 
        "\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy journey. \u2026\u201d",

        "\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.", 
        "Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.", 
        "\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d", 
        "Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.",

        "\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Ver\u00adnon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.", 
        "Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.", 
        "\u201cAnyway \u2014 Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here \u2014 I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d", 
        "From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with  written on it in green icing.", 
        "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said in\u00adstead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d", 
        "The giant chuckled.", 
        "\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d",

        "His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.", 
        "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a lit\u00adtle. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d", 
        "The giant chuckled darkly.",

        "He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain any\u00adthing, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d", 
        "The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.",

About a hundred more goblins were sit\u00adting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.",

        "\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d", 
        "The goblin read the letter carefully.", 
        "\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d", 
        "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thir\u00adteen?\u201d Harry asked.", 
        "\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More\u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d", 
        "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had ex\u00adpected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply down\u00adward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in \u2014 Hagrid with some difficulty \u2014 and were off.", 
        "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering.", 
        "Harry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \u2014 they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.", 
        "\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d", 
        "\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d", 
        "He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.", 
        "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billow\u00ading out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.", 
        "\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.", 
        "All Harry\u2019s \u2014 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blink\u00ading. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.", 
        "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.", 
        "\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d", 
        "\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.", 
        "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Ha\u00adgrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.", 
        "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.", 
        "\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.", 
        "\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook.", 
        "\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked.", 
        "\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.", 
        "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least \u2014 but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.", 
        "\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid.", 
        "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life \u2014 more money than even Dudley had ever had.", 
        "\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.", 
        "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.", 
        "\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here \u2014 another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d", 
        "In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.", 
        "\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d", 
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully fa\u00adther into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d",

        "\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.", 
        "\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been \u2014 imagine be\u00ading in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d", 
        "\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.", 
        "\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.", 
        "\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d",

        "\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.", 
        "\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of  \u2014 lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.",

        "\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like go\u00ading into the matter with this boy.", 
        "\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were  kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d",

        "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talk\u00ading to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.",

        "Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now \u2014 only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d", 
        "A magic wand \u2026 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.", 
        "The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.", 
        "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.", 
        "\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.", 
        "An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shin\u00ading like moons through the gloom of the shop.", 
        "\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.", 
        "\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d", 
        "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.", 
        "\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for trans\u00adfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it \u2014 it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d", 
        "Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.", 
        "\u201cAnd that\u2019s where \u2026\u201d", 
        "Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands \u2026 well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do. \u2026\u201d", 
        "He shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid.", 
        "\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. \u2026 Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.", 
        "\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.", 
        "\u201cEr \u2014 yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly.", 
        "\u201cBut you don\u2019t  them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply.", 
        "\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.", 
        "\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now \u2014 Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape mea\u00adsure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d", 
        "\u201cEr \u2014 well, I\u2019m right-handed,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoul\u00adder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d", 
        "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was mea\u00adsuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Olli\u00advander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.", 
        "\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\u201d", 
        "Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.", 
        "\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try \u2014\u201d", 
        "Harry tried \u2014 but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.", 
        "\u201cNo, no \u2014 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d", 
        "Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.", 
        "\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere \u2014 I wonder, now \u2014 yes, why not \u2014 unusual combination \u2014 holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d", 
        "Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well \u2026 how curious \u2026 how very curious \u2026\u201d", 
        "He put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious \u2026 curious \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut  curious?\u201d", 
        "Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.", 
        "\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather \u2014 just one other. It is very curious in\u00addeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother \u2014 why, its brother gave you that scar.\u201d", 
        "Harry swallowed.", 
        "\u201cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. \u2026 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. \u2026 After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things \u2014 terrible, yes, but great.\u201d", 
        "Harry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Olli\u00advander bowed them from his shop.", 
        "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Ha\u00adgrid tapped him on the shoulder.", 
        "\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said.", 
        "He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.", 
        "\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.", 
        "Harry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birth\u00adday of his life \u2014 and yet \u2014 he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.", 
        "\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander \u2026 but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol-, sorry \u2014 I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d",

Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts \u2014 I did \u2014 still do, \u2019smat\u00adter of fact.\u201d",

        "Harry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him \u2014 in fact, they didn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did be\u00adcome a bit depressing after a while.", 
        "Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in  His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, count\u00ading down to September the first.", 
        "On the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.",

He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes \u2014 he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.", 
        "They reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.", 
        "\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine \u2014 platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d", 
        "He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.", 
        "\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone.", 
        "He stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stu\u00adpid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog\u00adwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the mid\u00addle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.", 
        "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten.",

Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d",

Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d",

My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d", 
        "Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.",

He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.", 
        "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.",

        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.", 
        "\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale boy care\u00adlessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \u201cAnd my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d",

        "\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\u201d", 
        "He turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d",

        "\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d",

        "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle \u2014 Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scab\u00adbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disap\u00adpeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, because a sec\u00adond later, Hermione Granger had come in.", 
        "\u201cWhat  been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.", 
        "\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo \u2014 I don\u2019t believe it \u2014 he\u2019s gone back to sleep.\u201d",

My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with some\u00adthing?\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get there!\u201d",

        "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.", 
        "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers un\u00adderneath them.", 
        "A voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\u201d", 
        "Harry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.", 
        "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there, Harry?\u201d",

        "\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.",

        "And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.", 
        "\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.", 
        "\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who was check\u00ading the boats as people climbed out of them.", 
        "\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.",

        "\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d", 
        "She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble stair\u00adcase facing them led to the upper floors.", 
        "They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right \u2014 the rest of the school must already be here \u2014 but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.",

The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.", 
        "\u201cThe four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog\u00adwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.",

        "\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d", 
        "Harry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet \u2014 what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and wondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.",

Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \u201cand follow me.\u201d", 
        "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.", 
        "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the stu\u00addents were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candle\u00adlight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked up\u00adward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in \u201d", 
        "It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens.", 
        "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in the house.", 
        "Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing \u2014 noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth \u2014 and the hat began to sing:",

The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the mo\u00adment.

        "\u201c did she say?\u201d", 
        "\u201c Harry Potter?\u201d", 
        "The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.", 
        "\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\u2019s talent, oh my goodness, yes \u2014 and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting. \u2026 So where shall I put you?\u201d", 
        "Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought,", 
        "\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that \u2014 no? Well, if you\u2019re sure \u2014 better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d", 
        "Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d Harry sat down op\u00adposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.", 
        "He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quir\u00adrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.", 
        "And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fin\u00adgers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d", 
        "Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.", 
        "\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.", 
        "Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.", 
        "Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.", 
        "\u201cWelcome!\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Be\u00adfore we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!", 
        "\u201cThank you!\u201d", 
        "He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.", 
        "\u201cIs he \u2014 a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.", 
        "\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u201d", 
        "Harry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.", 
        "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.", 
        "\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.", 
        "\u201cCan\u2019t you \u2014 ?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your ser\u00advice. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy brothers told me about you \u2014 you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u201d", 
        "\u201cI would  you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \u2014\u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.", 
        "\u201c Headless? How can you be  headless?\u201d", 
        "Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.", 
        "\u201cLike \u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo \u2014 new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming almost unbear\u00adable \u2014 he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u201d", 
        "Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.", 
        "\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus with great in\u00adterest.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.", 
        "When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate \u00e9clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pud\u00adding \u2026", 
        "As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d", 
        "The others laughed.", 
        "\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me \u2014 he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned \u2014 but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid of\u00adfered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced \u2014 all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here \u2014 they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\u201d", 
        "On Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talk\u00ading about lessons (\u201cI  hope they start right away, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s supposed to be very difficult \u2014\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing \u2014\u201d).", 
        "Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Pro\u00adfessor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.", 
        "It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes \u2014 and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.", 
        "\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.", 
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.", 
        "\u201cN-nothing.\u201d", 
        "The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\u2019s look \u2014 a feel\u00ading that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all.", 
        "\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he asked Percy.", 
        "\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s look\u00ading so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to \u2014 everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d", 
        "Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t look at him again.", 
        "At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.", 
        "\u201cAhem \u2014 just a few more words now that we are all fed and wa\u00adtered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.", 
        "\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbid\u00adden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.", 
        "\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corri\u00addors.", 
        "\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.", 
        "\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corri\u00addor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d", 
        "Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.", 
        "\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.", 
        "\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go somewhere \u2014 the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\u201d", 
        "\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.", 
        "Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.", 
        "\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand off we go!\u201d", 
        "And the school bellowed:",

        "\u201d", 
        "Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.", 
        "\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u201d", 
        "The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden be\u00adhind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.", 
        "A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing them\u00adselves at him.", 
        "\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA poltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves \u2014 show yourself.\u201d",

        "There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.", 
        "\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle Firsties! What fun!\u201d", 
        "He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.", 
        "\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u201d barked Percy.", 
        "Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.", 
        "\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as they set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\u201d", 
        "At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.", 
        "\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.", 
        "\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it \u2014 Neville needed a leg up \u2014 and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.", 
        "Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase \u2014 they were obviously in one of the towers \u2014 they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.", 
        "\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through the hang\u00adings. \u201cGet  Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u201d", 
        "Harry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.", 
        "Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully \u2014 and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it \u2014 then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold \u2014 there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.", 
        "He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all."

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tip\u00adtoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.", 
        "There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led some\u00adwhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where any\u00adthing was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.", 
        "The ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d", 
        "Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the en\u00adtrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.", 
        "Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school bet\u00adter than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.", 
        "And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.", 
        "They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.", 
        "Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.", 
        "Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.", 
        "Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.", 
        "\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\u201d", 
        "Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.", 
        "The class everyone had really been looking forward to was De\u00adfense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.", 
        "Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have much of a head start.", 
        "Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.",

Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their own\u00aders, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.", 
        "Hedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, how\u00adever, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:",

        "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.", 
        "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry \u2014 he  him.", 
        "Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.", 
        "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.", 
        "\u201cAh, \u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new \u2014 \u201d", 
        "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered be\u00adhind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.", 
        "\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word \u2014 like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. \u2026 I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death \u2014 if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d", 
        "More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron ex\u00adchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a dunderhead.", 
        "\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d", 
        "? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot into the air.", 
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "Snape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer.", 
        "\u201cTut, tut \u2014 fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d", 
        "He ignored Hermione\u2019s hand.", 
        "\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201d", 
        "Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.", 
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u201d", 
        "Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He  looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in ?", 
        "Snape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.", 
        "\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs\u00adbane?\u201d", 
        "At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.", 
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d", 
        "A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.", 
        "\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so power\u00adful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d", 
        "There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\u201d", 
        "Things didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.", 
        "\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\u201d", 
        "Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.", 
        "\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.", 
        "\u201cYou \u2014 Potter \u2014 why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d", 
        "This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\u201d", 
        "As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week \u2014  did Snape hate him so much?", 
        "\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u201d", 
        "At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.", 
        "When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from in\u00adside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, say\u00ading, \u201c, Fang \u2014 \u201d", 
        "Hagrid\u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.", 
        "\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201c Fang.\u201d", 
        "He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.", 
        "There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.", 
        "\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.", 
        "\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling wa\u00adter into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.", 
        "\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\u201d", 
        "The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.", 
        "Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \u201cthat old git.\u2019\u2019", 
        "\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her \u2014 Filch puts her up to it.\u201d", 
        "Harry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the stu\u00addents.", 
        "\u201cBut he seemed to really  me.\u201d", 
        "\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d", 
        "Yet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes when he said that.", 
        "\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI liked him a lot \u2014 great with animals.\u201d", 
        "Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the :", 
        "GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST", 
        "Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.", 
        "Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.", 
        "\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this after\u00adnoon.", 
        "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date.", 
        "\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u201d", 
        "There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again.  Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?", 
        "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?"

        "Chapter 9", 
        "Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday \u2014 and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.", 
        "\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u201d", 
        "He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than any\u00adthing else.", 
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u201d", 
        "Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broom\u00adstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had al\u00adready had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.", 
        "Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordi\u00adnary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.", 
        "Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book \u2014 not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library book called  Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.", 
        "Harry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.", 
        "A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grand\u00admother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I forget things \u2014 this tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red \u2014 oh \u2026\u201d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c\u2026 you\u2019ve forgotten something \u2026\u201d", 
        "Neville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Re\u00admembrall out of his hand.", 
        "Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.",

        "\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.", 
        "At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffin\u00addors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the for\u00adbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.", 
        "The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broom\u00adsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.", 
        "Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.", 
        "\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u201d", 
        "Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.", 
        "\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called Madam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019 \u201d", 
        "\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.", 
        "Harry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.", 
        "Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows cor\u00adrecting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years.", 
        "\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle \u2014 three \u2014 two \u2014\u201d", 
        "But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.", 
        "\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle \u2014 twelve feet \u2014 twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and \u2014", 
        "WHAM \u2014 a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.",

        "\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on, boy \u2014 it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d",

        "Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.",

        "Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Mal\u00adfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.",

He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant.

        "Harry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.", 
        "\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\u201d Profes\u00adsor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d",

        "\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.  in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. \u2026\u201d",

        "It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it.", 
        "\u201c?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years  \u2014 you must be the youngest House player in about \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only \u2014 no contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d", 
        "\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m his second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d",

        "\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly, \u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d",

        "\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.", 
        "\u201c\u2014 and you  go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u201d", 
        "\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "All the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Mal\u00adfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness \u2014 this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.", 
        "\u201cHalf-past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better go.\u201d", 
        "They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.

        "A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.",

        "But what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.",

        "\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\u201d",

        "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.", 
        "Malfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.", 
        "\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.", 
        "Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.", 
        "\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u201d", 
        "It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.", 
        "\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter, \u201cprobably hiding.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a fright\u00adened squeak and broke into a run \u2014 he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.", 
        "The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.", 
        "\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following \u2014 they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going \u2014 they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.", 
        "\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.",

        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\u201d said Ron, \u201cquickly as possible.\u201d",

        "\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d", 
        "They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u2019s shouts.", 
        "\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \u201c!\u201d", 
        "The lock clicked and the door swung open \u2014 they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.", 
        "\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying. \u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d", 
        "\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019 \u201d",

        "\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.", 
        "\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay \u2014 get  Neville!\u201d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the last minute. \u201c?\u201d",

        "They weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a cor\u00adridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.", 
        "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.", 
        "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly get\u00adting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.",

        "They fell backward \u2014 Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hur\u00adried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared \u2014 all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.", 
        "\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.", 
        "\u201cNever mind that \u2014 pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.",

        "\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d",

        "\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo,  the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously guarding something.\u201d", 
        "She stood up, glaring at them.",

        "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. \u2026 What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide \u2014 except perhaps Hog\u00adwarts.",

Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.", 
        "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.", 
        "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.", 
        "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s at\u00adtention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his ba\u00adcon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when an\u00adother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.", 
        "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:", 
        "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.", 
        "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u2019clock for your first training ses\u00adsion.", 
        "Professor M. McGonagall", 
        "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.", 
        "\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve never even  one.\u201d", 
        "They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.", 
        "\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d", 
        "Ron couldn\u2019t resist it.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d", 
        "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Mal\u00adfoy\u2019s elbow.", 
        "\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.", 
        "\u201cPotters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly.", 
        "\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u201d", 
        "\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he added.", 
        "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion.", 
        "\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I wouldn\u2019t be on the team. \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.", 
        "\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so much good.\u201d", 
        "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.", 
        "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broom\u00adstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his din\u00adner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.", 
        "\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bed\u00adspread.", 
        "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.", 
        "As seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.", 
        "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling \u2014 he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.", 
        "\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d", 
        "Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.", 
        "\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGona\u00adgall meant \u2026 you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d", 
        "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.", 
        "\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to under\u00adstand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.", 
        "\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d", 
        "\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo \u2014 that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.", 
        "\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.", 
        "\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the Keeper \u2014 I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d", 
        "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d", 
        "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.", 
        "\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.", 
        "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air \u2014 it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.", 
        "\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on each team \u2014 the Weasley twins are ours \u2014 it\u2019s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So \u2014 think you\u2019ve got all that?\u201d", 
        "\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.", 
        "\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.", 
        "\u201cEr \u2014 have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry asked, hop\u00ading he sounded offhand.", 
        "\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201c\u2014 unless they crack my head open.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers them\u00adselves.\u201d", 
        "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.", 
        "\u201c\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most im\u00adportant ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages \u2014 I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.", 
        "\u201cWell, that\u2019s it \u2014 any questions?\u201d", 
        "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.", 
        "\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u201d", 
        "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.", 
        "Harry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on.", 
        "\u201cThat Quidditch Cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d", 
        "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.", 
        "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of bak\u00ading pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the class\u00adroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.", 
        "\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practic\u00ading!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too \u2014 never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f\u2019 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u201d", 
        "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it \u2014 Harry had to put it out with his hat.", 
        "Ron, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.", 
        "\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap. \u201cIt\u2019s Wing--dium Levi--sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and long.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.", 
        "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \u201c!\u201d", 
        "Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.", 
        "\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d", 
        "Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d", 
        "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face \u2014 and was startled to see that she was in tears.", 
        "\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d", 
        "\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d", 
        "Hermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all af\u00adternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Hal\u00adloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.", 
        "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, mak\u00ading the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared sud\u00addenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.", 
        "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll \u2014 in the dun\u00adgeons \u2014 thought you ought to know.\u201d", 
        "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.", 
        "There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers explod\u00ading from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.", 
        "\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the dormito\u00adries immediately!\u201d", 
        "Percy was in his element.", 
        "\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d", 
        "\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\u201d", 
        "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different di\u00adrections. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve just thought \u2014 Hermione.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat about her?\u201d", 
        "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d", 
        "Ron bit his lip.", 
        "\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u201d", 
        "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.", 
        "\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.", 
        "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d", 
        "\u201cSearch me.\u201d", 
        "Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u2019s fading footsteps.", 
        "\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.", 
        "\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d", 
        "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.", 
        "And then they heard it \u2014 a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed \u2014 at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moon\u00adlight.", 
        "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, gran\u00adite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.", 
        "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It wag\u00adgled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.", 
        "\u201cThe key\u2019s in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in.\u201d", 
        "\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.", 
        "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry man\u00adaged to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d", 
        "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop \u2014 a high, petrified scream \u2014 and it was coming from the chamber they\u2019d just chained up.", 
        "\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d they said together.", 
        "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.", 
        "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.", 
        "\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.", 
        "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.", 
        "\u201cOy, pea-brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.", 
        "\u201cCome on, run, !\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.", 
        "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.", 
        "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stu\u00adpid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when he\u2019d jumped \u2014 it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.", 
        "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.", 
        "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand \u2014 not knowing what he was going to do he heard him\u00adself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201c!\u201d", 
        "The club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over \u2014 and dropped, with a sicken\u00ading crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.",

        "He wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.", 
        "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.", 
        "Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s mind.", 
        "\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGona\u00adgall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d",

        "\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\u201d", 
        "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to them.", 
        "\u201cWell \u2014 in that case \u2026\u201d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u201d", 
        "Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.", 
        "\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Stu\u00addents are finishing the feast in their Houses.\u201d", 
        "Hermione left.", 
        "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.", 
        "\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d", 
        "They hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.", 
        "\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron grumbled.", 
        "\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u201d", 
        "\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cMind you, we  save her.\u201d", 
        "\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.", 
        "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.", 
        "\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.", 
        "The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d and hurried off to get plates.", 
        "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."

        "As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrost\u00ading broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.", 
        "The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.", 
        "Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\u2019t know which was worse \u2014 people telling him he\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around under\u00adneath him holding a mattress.", 
        "It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework with\u00adout her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him  which turned out to be a very interesting read.", 
        "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of commit\u00adting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died play\u00ading Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.", 
        "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.",

She would never let them copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.", 
        "Harry felt restless. He wanted  back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was go\u00ading to ask Snape if he could have it.", 
        "\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening.", 
        "He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.", 
        "Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside \u2014 and a horrible scene met his eyes.",

        "\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished breathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we saw him \u2014 he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d bet my broomstick  let that troll in, to make a diversion!\u201d",

        "\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or some\u00adthing,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d",

It said  and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.",

        "Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrat\u00ading so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good \u2014 every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and cir\u00adcled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.", 
        "\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.", 
        "Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\u2019s robes.", 
        "It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row \u2014 Snape would never know what had happened.", 
        "It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clam\u00adber back on to his broom.", 
        "\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.", 
        "Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick \u2014 he hit the field on all fours \u2014 coughed \u2014 and something gold fell into his hand.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.", 
        "\u201cHe didn\u2019t  it, he nearly  it,\u201d Flint was still howl\u00ading twenty minutes later, but it made no difference \u2014 Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results \u2014 Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione.", 
        "\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d", 
        "\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy would Snape do some\u00adthin\u2019 like that?\u201d", 
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.", 
        "\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid. \u201cHe tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d", 
        "Hagrid dropped the teapot.", 
        "\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.",

        "\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to  it.\u201d",

        "\u201cSo why did he just try and kill Harry?\u201d cried Hermione.", 
        "The afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.",

        "\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019 know why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a stu\u00addent! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh \u2014 yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel in\u00advolved, is there?\u201d",

        "Chapter 12", 
        "Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for be\u00adwitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.", 
        "No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryf\u00adfindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot caul\u00addrons.", 
        "\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d", 
        "He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d real\u00adized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so im\u00adpressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunt\u00ading Harry about having no proper family.", 
        "It was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week be\u00adfore, making a list of students who would be staying for the holi\u00addays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.", 
        "When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.", 
        "\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.", 
        "\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose \u2014 that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d", 
        "Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.", 
        "\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d", 
        "Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.", 
        "\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d", 
        "\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u201d", 
        "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scat\u00adtering needles everywhere and smirking.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d", 
        "\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u201d", 
        "So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.", 
        "\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree \u2014 put it in the far corner, would you?\u201d", 
        "The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christ\u00admas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.", 
        "\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d Hagrid asked.", 
        "\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me \u2014 Harry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the li\u00adbrary.\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.", 
        "\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly. \u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who he is.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou ?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here \u2014 I\u2019ve told yeh \u2014 drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione.", 
        "\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere \u2014 just give us a hint \u2014 I know I\u2019ve read his name somewhere.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.", 
        "\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.", 
        "They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in  or ; he was missing, too, from  and  And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.", 
        "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.", 
        "\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.", 
        "\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on \u2014 out!\u201d", 
        "Wishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.", 
        "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been look\u00ading for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments be\u00adtween lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breath\u00ading down their necks.", 
        "Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.", 
        "\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d", 
        "\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d", 
        "\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.", 
        "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork \u2014 bread, English muffins, marshmallows \u2014 and plotting ways of get\u00adting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t work.", 
        "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family \u2014 in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.", 
        "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send  we can afford to lose \u201d", 
        "On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.", 
        "\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.", 
        "\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got some pre\u00adsents!\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.", 
        "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it him\u00adself. Harry blew it \u2014 it sounded a bit like an owl.", 
        "A second, very small parcel contained a note.", 
        "Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.", 
        "\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is ?\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle \u2014 so who sent these?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any presents and \u2014 oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you a Weasley sweater.\u201d", 
        "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.", 
        "\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s  maroon.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.", 
        "His next present also contained candy \u2014 a large box of Choco\u00adlate Frogs from Hermione.", 
        "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.", 
        "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten from Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is \u2014 they\u2019re really rare, and  valuable.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d", 
        "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is \u2014 try it on.\u201d", 
        "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.", 
        "\u201cIt ! Look down!\u201d", 
        "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished com\u00adpletely.", 
        "\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of it!\u201d", 
        "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in nar\u00adrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:", 
        "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.", 
        "Use it well.", 
        "A Very Merry Christmas to you.", 
        "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admir\u00ading the cloak.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019d give  for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201c What\u2019s the matter?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?", 
        "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.", 
        "\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d", 
        "\u201cHey, look \u2014 Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d",

        "\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.", 
        "\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid \u2014 we know we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise?\u201d",

        "\u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 want \u2014\u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.", 
        "\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d", 
        "They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.", 
        "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hun\u00addred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \u2014 and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.", 
        "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lop\u00adsided.", 
        "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Nor\u00adris\u2019s Christmas dinner.", 
        "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furi\u00adous snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacu\u00adlarly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.", 
        "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christ\u00admas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.", 
        "It had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.", 
        "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.", 
        "His father\u2019s \u2026 this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.  the note had said.", 
        "He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moon\u00adlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.", 
        "Use it well.", 
        "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.", 
        "Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back \u2014 his father\u2019s cloak \u2014 he felt that this time \u2014 the first time \u2014 he wanted to use it alone.", 
        "He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the com\u00admon room, and climbed through the portrait hole.", 
        "\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.", 
        "Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.", 
        "The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.", 
        "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.", 
        "They didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.", 
        "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balanc\u00ading it on his knee, let it fall open.", 
        "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \u2014 the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside \u2014 stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears.", 
        "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t rec\u00adognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.", 
        "\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library \u2014 Restricted Section.\u201d", 
        "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was get\u00adting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Re\u00adstricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d", 
        "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a nar\u00adrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him \u2014 the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.", 
        "He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get in\u00adside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.", 
        "It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \u2014 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.", 
        "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top:", 
        "His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at him\u00adself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.", 
        "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed \u2014 for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.", 
        "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.", 
        "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder \u2014 but still, no one was there. Or were they all in\u00advisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?", 
        "He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \u2014 she and the others existed only in the mirror.", 
        "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes \u2014  Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green \u2014 exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\u2019s did.", 
        "Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.", 
        "\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d", 
        "They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees \u2014 Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.", 
        "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a pow\u00aderful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.", 
        "How long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, whis\u00adpered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the room.", 
        "\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.", 
        "\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.", 
        "\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d", 
        "Harry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?", 
        "\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d", 
        "What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from the library, wandering around the dark passage\u00adways for nearly an hour.", 
        "\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d", 
        "\u201c!\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cI know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d", 
        "They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite di\u00adrection, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s here \u2014 just here \u2014 yes!\u201d", 
        "They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.", 
        "There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.", 
        "\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.", 
        "\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d", 
        "\u201cLook! Look at them all \u2026 there are loads of them. \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cI can only see you.\u201d", 
        "\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d", 
        "Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.", 
        "Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.", 
        "\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.", 
        "\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo \u2014 I\u2019m alone \u2014 but I\u2019m different \u2014 I look older \u2014 and I\u2019m Head Boy!\u201d",

        "\u201cI am \u2014 I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to \u2014 and I\u2019m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup \u2014 I\u2019m Quidditch captain, too!\u201d", 
        "Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.", 
        "\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d", 
        "\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead \u2014 let me have another look \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u201d",

        "\u201cQuick!\u201d", 
        "Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing \u2014 did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.", 
        "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe \u2014 she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\u201d", 
        "And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.",

        "\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it \u2014 and anyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u201d",

        "That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone.", 
        "And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.", 
        "Except \u2014", 
        "\u201cSo \u2014 back again, Harry?\u201d", 
        "Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked be\u00adhind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.", 
        "\u201cI \u2014 I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d", 
        "\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.", 
        "\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d",

        "\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d", 
        "Harry shook his head.", 
        "\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u201d", 
        "Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us what we want \u2026 whatever we want \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. How\u00adever, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.", 
        "\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever  run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d",

        "\u201cSir \u2014 Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u201d", 
        "\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d", 
        "Harry stared.", 
        "\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAn\u00adother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\u201d", 
        "It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question."

        "Chapter 13", 
        "Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.", 
        "\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.", 
        "Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had caught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.", 
        "They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.", 
        "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Champi\u00adonship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.", 
        "Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pre\u00adtending to fall off their brooms.", 
        "\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d",

        "Harry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could \u2014 yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.", 
        "Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wonder\u00ading whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.", 
        "Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.",

        "It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and of\u00adfered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.",

That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts \u2014 I s\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you  know, you know everything that goes on round here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had  the guarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u201d",

        "\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the village havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u201d",

Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on \u2019em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here \u2014 how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs \u2014 what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d",

        "But Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.",

        "\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra home\u00adwork they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.", 
        "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words:",

        "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.",

        "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.", 
        "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.", 
        "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.", 
        "\u201cIsn\u2019t he ?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.",

The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.", 
        "\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for fright\u00adening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u201d",

        "There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey \u2014 would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poisonous.",

He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me \u2014 I\u2019ve told her it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s do\u00ading this.\u201d",

Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.

Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone be\u00ading up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds ex\u00adcept for classes.

        "A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?", 
        "Harry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of any\u00adthing to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryf\u00adfindor found out what they\u2019d done?", 
        "At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.", 
        "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \u201cThanks Potter, we owe you one!\u201d",

        "\u201cWell \u2014 no,\u201d Ron admitted.", 
        "It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.", 
        "\u201c?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u201d", 
        "But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe Seeker.\u201d", 
        "Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well-known, but no\u00adbody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.", 
        "Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. \u2026", 
        "Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice.",

        "Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had dis\u00adappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.", 
        "All the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step \u2014 Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.", 
        "Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard.", 
        "\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell \u2014\u201d",

So what do we do, Harry?\u201d", 
        "The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.", 
        "\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201d", 
        "\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no !\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too scared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor \u2014 who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d",

        "Professor M. McGonagall", 
        "Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.", 
        "At eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there \u2014 and so was Malfoy. Harry had also for\u00adgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.", 
        "\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them out\u00adside.",

        "They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so de\u00adlighted.", 
        "The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throw\u00ading them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted win\u00addows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.", 
        "\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d", 
        "Harry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, be\u00adcause Filch said, \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy \u2014 it\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece.\u201d",

        "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Mal\u00adfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.", 
        "\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups \u2014 Neville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d", 
        "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow be\u00adcause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.", 
        "\u201cLook \u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.", 
        "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.", 
        "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.", 
        "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clear\u00ading quivered. \u2026 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to drink its blood.", 
        "\u201cAAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d", 
        "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \u2014 so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry \u2014 unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry \u2014 he couldn\u2019t move for fear.", 
        "Then a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.", 
        "The pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.", 
        "\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.", 
        "\u201cYes \u2014 thank you \u2014 what  that?\u201d", 
        "The centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.", 
        "\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time \u2014 especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.", 
        "\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.", 
        "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.", 
        "\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a hu\u00adman on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d", 
        "\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane. \u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d", 
        "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his gloomy voice.", 
        "Bane kicked his back legs in anger.", 
        "\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are con\u00adcerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\u201d", 
        "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.", 
        "\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this for\u00adest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d", 
        "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane be\u00adhind them.", 
        "Harry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.", 
        "\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d", 
        "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\u2019s ques\u00adtion. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, how\u00adever, when Firenze suddenly stopped.", 
        "\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\u201d", 
        "Harry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.", 
        "\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf you\u2019re go\u00ading to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else \u2014 something that will bring you back to full strength and power \u2014 something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d", 
        "\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course \u2014 the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d", 
        "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was  \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hur\u00adried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are safe now.\u201d", 
        "Harry slid off his back.", 
        "\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\u201d",

        "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.",

        "Chapter 16", 
        "In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.", 
        "It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.", 
        "They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox \u2014 points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remem\u00adber how to make a Forgetfulness potion.", 
        "Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.", 
        "Maybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their fore\u00adheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.", 
        "Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of an\u00adswering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented self-stirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Profes\u00adsor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest.", 
        "\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d", 
        "Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers after\u00adward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.

        "Harry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important.

How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d",

He\u2019s found out everything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u201d",

        "\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can it?\u201d", 
        "Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.", 
        "\u201cBe warned, Potter \u2014 any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u201d",

        "\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape \u2014 wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhy me?\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a high voice, \u201c \u2018Oh Profes\u00adsor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen  wrong. \u2026\u2019 \u201d",

        "\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of en\u00adchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!\u201d", 
        "Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.",

        "\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.",

Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter any\u00admore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d", 
        "He glared at them.",

        "\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u201d", 
        "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had any\u00adthing to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.", 
        "Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.", 
        "\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormi\u00adtory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha\u00adgrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy \u2014 he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.", 
        "He ran back down to the common room.", 
        "\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us \u2014 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for free\u00addom.", 
        "\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.",

        "\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d",

        "\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d", 
        "\u201c\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and don\u2019t be an idiot \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d", 
        "\u201cYes, but not to \u201d said Ron in exasperation. \u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",

        "\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d", 
        "She raised her wand.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.", 
        "Neville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.", 
        "Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed to\u00adgether so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body-Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d", 
        "\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.", 
        "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.", 
        "At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.", 
        "\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do any\u00adthing.", 
        "They didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.", 
        "\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d", 
        "He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.", 
        "\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a-creeping around unseen.\u201d", 
        "Harry had a sudden idea.", 
        "\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d", 
        "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.", 
        "\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\u201d he said greasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake \u2014 I didn\u2019t see you \u2014 of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible \u2014 forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay away from this place tonight.\u201d", 
        "\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d", 
        "And he scooted off.", 
        "\u201c Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.", 
        "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor cor\u00adridor \u2014 and the door was already ajar.", 
        "\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s already got past Fluffy.\u201d", 
        "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.", 
        "\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.", 
        "Harry pushed the door open.", 
        "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.", 
        "\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it there.\u201d", 
        "\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, here goes \u2026\u201d", 
        "He put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased \u2014 it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.", 
        "\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.", 
        "\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron, peering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first, Hermione?\u201d", 
        "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d", 
        "\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.", 
        "\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.", 
        "\u201cNothing \u2014 just black \u2014 there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d", 
        "Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his at\u00adtention and pointed at himself.", 
        "\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d", 
        "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.", 
        "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.", 
        "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u201d", 
        "\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope. \u2026\u201d", 
        "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and \u2014", 
        "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.", 
        "\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d", 
        "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.", 
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.", 
        "\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d", 
        "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other side.", 
        "\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.", 
        "\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201c!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d", 
        "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.", 
        "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.", 
        "\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what this is \u2014 it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.", 
        "\u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said Her\u00admione.", 
        "\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.", 
        "\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare \u2026 what did Professor Sprout say? \u2014 it likes the dark and the damp \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.", 
        "\u201cYes \u2014 of course \u2014 but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione cried, wringing her hands.", 
        "\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.", 
        "\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.", 
        "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a cri\u00adsis \u2014 \u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 \u201d", 
        "\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.", 
        "All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped down\u00adward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon \u2014 Norbert had been bad enough \u2026", 
        "\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.", 
        "Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be com\u00ading from up ahead.", 
        "\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d", 
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead \u2014 I can see something moving.\u201d", 
        "They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.", 
        "\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, but I sup\u00adpose if they all swooped down at once \u2026 well, there\u2019s no other choice \u2026 I\u2019ll run.\u201d", 
        "He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.", 
        "The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.", 
        "\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.", 
        "\u201cThese birds \u2026 they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said Hermione.", 
        "They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \u2014 ?", 
        "\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re ! Winged keys \u2014 look carefully. So that must mean \u2026\u201d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \u201c\u2026 yes \u2014 look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u201d",

        "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soar\u00ading into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.", 
        "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. Af\u00adter a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had al\u00adready been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.", 
        "\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one \u2014 there \u2014 no, there \u2014 with bright blue wings \u2014 the feathers are all crum\u00adpled on one side.\u201d",

        "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed around the high chamber.", 
        "They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key strug\u00adgling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned \u2014 it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.", 
        "\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door han\u00addle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.", 
        "The next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to re\u00adveal an astonishing sight.", 
        "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shiv\u00adered slightly \u2014 the towering white chessmen had no faces.",

        "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way across the room.\u201d",

        "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.", 
        "\u201cDo we \u2014 er \u2014 have to join you to get across?\u201d", 
        "The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.", 
        "\u201cThis needs thinking about. \u2026\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. \u2026\u201d", 
        "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.", 
        "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.", 
        "\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering across the board. \u201cYes \u2026 look \u2026\u201d", 
        "A white pawn had moved forward two squares.", 
        "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost?", 
        "\u201cHarry \u2014 move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d",

        "\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken. \u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u201d", 
        "Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.", 
        "\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me think \u2014 let me think \u2026\u201d",

        "\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some sacri\u00adfices! I make my move and she\u2019ll take me \u2014 that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d",

        "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.", 
        "The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.",

        "\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",

        "But he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.",

        "\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\u201d",

        "Harry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The tur\u00adban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.", 
        "Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.", 
        "\u201cHarry Potter \u2026\u201d it whispered.", 
        "Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.", 
        "\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere shadow and va\u00adpor \u2026 I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body \u2026 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. \u2026 Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks \u2026 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the for\u00adest \u2026 and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own. \u2026 Now \u2026 why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d", 
        "So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.", 
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me \u2026 or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents. \u2026 They died begging me for mercy. \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.", 
        "Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.", 
        "\u201cHow touching \u2026\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery. \u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave. \u2026 I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight \u2026 but your mother needn\u2019t have died \u2026 she was trying to protect you. \u2026 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\u201d", 
        "\u201cNEVER!\u201d", 
        "Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened \u2014 he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers \u2014 they were blistering before his eyes.", 
        "\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quir\u00adrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s neck \u2014 Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.", 
        "\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him \u2014 my hands \u2014 my hands!\u201d", 
        "And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms \u2014 Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.", 
        "\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched Voldemort.", 
        "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face \u2014", 
        "\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d", 
        "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain \u2014 his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.", 
        "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off \u2014 the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building \u2014 he couldn\u2019t see \u2014 he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells of, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in Harry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d", 
        "He felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down \u2026 down \u2026 down \u2026", 
        "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.", 
        "He blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.", 
        "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.", 
        "\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore.", 
        "Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\u201d",

        "\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\u201d", 
        "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.", 
        "\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, how\u00adever, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d", 
        "\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d",

        "\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Profes\u00adsor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d", 
        "\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d", 
        "\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached Lon\u00addon than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you \u2014 the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d", 
        "\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend \u2014 Nicolas Flamel \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \u201cYou  do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d", 
        "\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d",

        "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face.", 
        "\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very,  long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all \u2014 the trou\u00adble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\u201d", 
        "Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.", 
        "\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking \u2026 Sir \u2014 even if the Stone\u2019s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who \u2014\u201d",

        "\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share \u2026 not being truly alive, he can\u00adnot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time \u2014 and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never re\u00adturn to power.\u201d", 
        "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some other things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me \u2026 things I want to know the truth about. \u2026\u201d", 
        "\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.

        "\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day \u2026 put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older \u2026 I know you hate to hear this \u2026 when you are ready, you will know.\u201d",

He didn\u2019t realize that love as power\u00adful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign \u2026 to have been loved so deeply, even though the per\u00adson who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this rea\u00adson. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u201d", 
        "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u201cAnd the Invisi\u00adbility Cloak \u2014 do you know who sent it to me?\u201d", 
        "\u201cAh \u2014 your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things \u2026 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\u201d",

You see, only one who wanted to  the Stone \u2014 find it, but not use it \u2014 would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see them\u00adselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes. \u2026 Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking for them \u2014 but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d",

I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\u2019s al\u00admost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. \u2026\u201d",

        "\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were \u2026 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts. \u2026", 
        "\u201cNow, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hun\u00addred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u201d", 
        "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.", 
        "\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, re\u00adcent events must be taken into account.\u201d", 
        "The room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little.", 
        "\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes \u2026", 
        "\u201cFirst \u2014 to Mr. Ronald Weasley \u2026\u201d", 
        "Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.", 
        "\u201c\u2026 for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\u201d", 
        "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u201d", 
        "At last there was silence again.", 
        "\u201cSecond \u2014 to Miss Hermione Granger \u2026 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\u201d", 
        "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves \u2014 they were a hundred points up.", 
        "\u201cThird \u2014 to Mr. Harry Potter \u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \u201c\u2026 for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.\u201d", 
        "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points \u2014 exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Cup \u2014 if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.", 
        "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.", 
        "\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d", 
        "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.", 
        "\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little change of decoration.\u201d", 
        "He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent van\u00adished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.", 
        "It was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls \u2026 he would never, ever forget tonight.", 
        "Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbol\u00adogy mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life.", 
        "And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us these,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the coun\u00adtryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross station.", 
        "It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wiz\u00adened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract atten\u00adtion by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.", 
        "\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \u201cboth of you \u2014 I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d", 
        "\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u201d", 
        "People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:", 
        "\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d", 
        "\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d", 
        "\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.", 
        "\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.", 
        "He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.", 
        "\u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d", 
        "It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t point\u00ading at Ron.", 
        "\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see \u2014\u201d", 
        "\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d", 
        "Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.", 
        "\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.", 
        "\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d", 
        "\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d", 
        "\u201cReady, are you?\u201d", 
        "It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.", 
        "\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.", 
        "\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry up, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.", 
        "Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.", 
        "\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d", 
        "\u201cHope you have \u2014 er \u2014 a good holiday,\u201d said Hermione, look\u00ading uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.", 
        "\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \u201c don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer. \u2026\u201d"
